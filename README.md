# Radar project in arduino

As a project, I decided to create a device that resembles a radar.

The ultrasonic sensor rotates on the servo, from 1 to 180 degrees and back. The result of the measurement is displayed on the LCD screen, along with the current position (angle) of the servo. If the calculated distance is less than 50 cm, the red LED lights up. Otherwise, the green LED stays lit.
